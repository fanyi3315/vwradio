0x2B Login
    Login with SAFE code works like on the Premium 5.  Reading
    group 0x19 responds with NAK but it's a lie, treat it like ACK.

0x01 Read RAM (Protected)
    All addresses 0x0000-0xFFFF return NAK.

0x03 Read ROM or EEPROM (Protected)
    Behaves exactly like 0x19 Read EEPROM.

0x19 Read EEPROM (Protected)
    Returns the contents of the 24C04 EEPROM (512 bytes).
    Responds with title 0xEF (unlike Premium 4 and 5 which respond with 0xFD).
    Only allows reading 0x0000-0x01FF (512 bytes) or else it returns NAK.
    Returns 0 for the SAFE code area 0x0010-0x0012.

0x0C Write EEPROM (Protected)
    Overwrites the contents of the 24C04 EEPROM (512) bytes.  Any
    address other than 0x0000-0x01FF (512 bytes) will return NAK.
    It allows overwriting every byte in this area.  It always responds
    with title 0xF9.

    It seems to work more like a "fill" than a "write", which may be
    a bug.  Only the first data byte in the list is written to the
    EEPROM.  If the data size byte is greater than 1, successive
    locations will be filled with the first data byte.

    Example:
        Try to write 3 bytes "ABC" to locations 0x0080-0x0082:

        SEND: 09 0E 0C 03 00 80 41 42 43 03
        RECV: 07 0F F9 03 00 80 00 03

        The result is that "A" will be written to all 3 locations.

    The SAFE code can be changed by writing the 3 encrypted bytes at
    0x0010-0x0012.  The change will not take effect until power is
    removed (pressing the power button is not enough).  Login will
    continue to work with the previous SAFE code until the unit is
    power cycled.  After power cycling, the new SAFE code must be used
    for login.
