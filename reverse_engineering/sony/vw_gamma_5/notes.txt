Maximum block length is 0xBD for the wrap-around behavior.  If block length is 0xBE or larger,
it just times out.


Hard Crash
----------

This block causes KWP1281 and the faceplate to become completely unresponsive.  No response is sent
and pushing the power button has no effect.  Power has to be removed from the radio to recover.

Notice that the 0x03 Block End byte was not sent.  The radio crashed before sending the complement
to byte 0x50.
