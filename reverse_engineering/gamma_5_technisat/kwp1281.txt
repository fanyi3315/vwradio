Address 0x56
------------

Login with the SAFE code works like on the Premium 5, reading
group 0x19 responds with NAK but it's a lie, treat it like ACK.

Address 0x7C
------------

Radio does not send the usual 55 01 8A, instead it sends these
unknown 5 bytes:

10 01 5E 00 90
            ^^ looks like (sum of previous 4 bytes)^0xff

After addressing the radio once on 0x7C, it will not send the
sequence again unless it is power cycled or the volume knob
is pushed twice (once to turn off, once again to turn back on).
