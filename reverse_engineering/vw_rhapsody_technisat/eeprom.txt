The hardware of the Rhapsody radio is very similar to the Gamma 5 radio.
Like the Gamma 5, it has two 24C08 EEPROMs near the rear wall.  The EEPROM
layouts are the same or very similar to the Gamma 5.  The SAFE code is
stored in the same locations.  It is in the EEPROM closest to the antenna
and is stored as four ASCII digits at offset 0x0C.
