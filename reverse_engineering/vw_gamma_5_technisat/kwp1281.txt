Address 0x56
------------

0x2B Login
    Login with SAFE code works like on the Premium 5, reading
    group 0x19 responds with NAK but it's a lie, treat it like ACK.

0x01 Read RAM
    Only allows reading 0-0x7FF (2K)
    2K is same amount of RAM as M38869FFAHP
    Contents look good for RAM
        LCD buffer possibly at 0x0121 (contains "DIAG.")
        KWP1281 buffers somewhere between 0x030F-0x0365
    Contents always have some differences between dumps (expected for RAM)

0x03 Read ROM or EEPROM
    Only allows reading 0x2000-0xFFFF (56K)
    M38869F'F'AHP (this MCU) should have 60K flash but the 'E' version
        has only 56K flash.  56K seems plausible as the flash ROM.
    Dumped all 56K three times; all dumps were identical (expected for ROM)
    No strings but XOR all bytes with 0xFF shows some strings with parts
        of radio LCD messages; looks encrypted

0x19 Read EEPROM
    Responds with title 0xEF (unlike Premium 4 which responds with 0xFD)
    Only allows reading 0-0x7ff (2K)
    Dumped all 2K many times; all are identical except for 2 bytes
        at offset 0x001e that are always different.
    24C08 is only 1K
    First half of the dump looks like the "right side" 24c08
        with the SAFE code filtered out
    Second half is unknown, not like the "left side" 24c08,
        and repeats a lot

Address 0x7C
------------

Radio does not send the usual 55 01 8A, instead it sends these
unknown 5 bytes:

10 01 5E 00 90
            ^^ looks like (sum of previous 4 bytes)^0xff

After addressing the radio once on 0x7C, it will not send the
sequence again unless it is power cycled or the volume knob
is pushed twice (once to turn off, once again to turn back on).
