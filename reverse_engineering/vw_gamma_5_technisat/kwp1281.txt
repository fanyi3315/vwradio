0x2B Login
    Login with SAFE code works like on the Premium 5, reading
    group 0x19 responds with NAK but it's a lie, treat it like ACK.

0x01 Read RAM
    Returns the contents of the M38869FFAHP's RAM.
    Only allows reading 0x0000-07FF but this is the entire RAM area.
    Data is returned unencrypted.

0x03 Read ROM or EEPROM
    Returns contents of the M38869FFAHP microcontroller's flash ROM.

    Only allows reading 0x2000-0xFFFF (56K) but this MCU (M38869F'F'AHP)
    has 60K flash.  The unreadable 4K is unused in the firmware (all 0xFF).
    The 'E' version of this MCU has only 56K flash, so the firmware
    probably targeted that version originally.

    Data is returned XOR encrypted using the last 256 bytes of the ROM
    (0xFF00-FFFF) as the key (see code around 0xA27E).

0x19 Read EEPROM
    Responds with title 0xEF (unlike Premium 4 which responds with 0xFD)
    Only allows reading 0-0x7ff (2K)
    Dumped all 2K many times; all are identical except for 2 bytes
        at offset 0x001e that are always different.
    24C08 is only 1K
    First half of the dump looks like the "right side" 24c08
        with the SAFE code filtered out
    Second half is unknown, not like the "left side" 24c08,
        and repeats a lot

Address 0x7C
------------

Radio does not send the usual 55 01 8A, instead it sends these
unknown 5 bytes:

10 01 5E 00 90
            ^^ looks like (sum of previous 4 bytes)^0xff

After addressing the radio once on 0x7C, it will not send the
sequence again unless it is power cycled or the volume knob
is pushed twice (once to turn off, once again to turn back on).
