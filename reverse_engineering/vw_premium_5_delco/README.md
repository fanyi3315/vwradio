## Firmware Versions

These radios have a sticker on the top of the case like "SOFTWARE 23" that indicates the firmware version.  I have found radios with the SOFTWARE 21, 23, 24, and 25.  I do not know the exact differences but all appear to have the same features and behavior (including all KWP1281 functions on addresses 0x56 and 0x7C).  The different versions are likely just bug fixes but this needs to be confirmed.  The disassemblies here are based on "SOFTWARE 23" because that is the first version I found.
