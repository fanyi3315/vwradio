Experiment with FL-PR3
----------------------

Performed chip erase.
Loaded 60K image of all 0x00
Verify fails, address = 0xEFFF.
Loaded 60K image of all 0xFF
Verify passes.

Chip is still erased.
Wrote file with offset 0 = 0x00, all others = 0xFF
Verify fails, address = 0xEFFF.
It should have failed verify at 0x0000.  Verify can't be used to check individual bytes.

Chip is still erased.
Programmed image with all 0xFF.
Program OK, verify OK.

Programmed again with all 0xFF.
Program OK, verify OK.

Programmed image with byte 0 = 0x7F, all others = 0xFF
Program OK, verify OK.

Programmed image with byte 0 = 0x3F, all others = 0xFF
Program OK, verify OK.

Verified against image with all 0xFF.
Verify failed. (expected)
Programmed image with all 0xFF.
Program failed, address = 0x00FF.  (unexpected address; only offset 0 was different)

Programmed image with byte 0 = 0x00, all others = 0xFF
Program OK, verify OK.

Observations:
 - Chip erase sets all bytes to 0xFF.
 - Any bit can be changed from 1 to 0 without chip erase.
 - Chip verify address is unreliable (says 0xEFFF when difference was at 0x0000)
 - Program verify address is unreliable (says 0x00FF when difference was at 0x0000)
 - FL-PR3 doesn't seem to allow writing to only part of flash

Instruction Set
---------------

78K0S is not binary compatible with 78K0:
 - 78K0S "NOP" encodes to 0x08
 - 78K0  "NOP" encodes to 0x00
