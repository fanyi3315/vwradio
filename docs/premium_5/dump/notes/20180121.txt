Attempt to Corrupt with 0xFF Finder
-----------------------------------

I burned a test program (16 bytes) into a China Surplus #1.  The test program
dumps all memory out a port.  Ran the 0xFF finder over just those 16 bytes
repeatedly all night.  The program still ran afterward and there was no
evidence of corruption.  There were no 0xFF areas in these bytes, perhaps that
matters.

Reset Weirdness
---------------

I noticed that the dumping program did not start consistently on power up but
that touching a ground wire to the reset pin brought it to life.  I installed
a DS1813 on the reset line which seems to have cured this.  However, the DS1813
seems to interfere with the FL-PR3, so it needs to be disconnected during flash
programming.

FL-PR3 Cable Weirdness
----------------------

I noticed that the dumping prgoram doesn't start at all if the FL-PR3 cable
is plugged in, even if there's nothing at the end of the cable.  It happens
with my homemade cable and the one that came with the FL-PR3.  Both are
straight cables with nothing on the other end.  It seems completely repeatable:
board works with cable unplugged, doesn't work with cable plugged in.  Just a
guess: it might have something to do with Vpp floating on the board.  The
datasheet says Vpp is supposed to be tied to 5V or GND when not in use.
